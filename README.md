# Designing the Game to Play: Optimizing Payoff Structure in Security Games 



This repo contains the code for reproducing the experiments for [payoff manipulation in security games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01987) (to appear in IJCAI-ECAI-18).

The code and README for the problems with L^1-norm and L^0-norm budget constraint sit in separate directories. Please refer to them for details of the experiments.

Any feedback and bug reports are welcome.
